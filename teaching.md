What is the influence of income on the probability of voting? Is there any systematic relationship between democracy and growth? Is it true that correlation does not imply causation? 

To consider these kind of statements in a rigorous way, we will introduce OLS, the workhorse of applied quantitative methodology in social sciences. At the end of the course you will become an educated consumer and producer of quantitative analysis.

This survey course covers the major components of U.S. national government. Beginning with the philosophical origins of American constitutionalism, we will proceed to discuss the political and economic context in which the Constitution was written and then examine in detail the Constitution and Bill of Rights. We will then proceed to discussion of the underpinnings of the Constitutional system such as American values, socialization, public opinion and the manner in which they operate.

The primary purpose of math camp is to provide students with a set of skills that will be needed to perform well in the quantitative methods courses offered at Rutgers and elsewhere. It will cover the foundational material of matrix algebra, basic calculus and basic probability.

The secondary purpose of math camp is to provide students with computational skills. The basics of  `LaTeX` and `R` will be covered.
