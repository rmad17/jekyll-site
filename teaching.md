Statistics are important to the study of political science in many ways. This class is thus an essential part of graduate education, and not only for those of who will go on to conduct quantitative research. The practical graduate student who would prefer not to starve realizes that the best dissertations – and job talks – involve multiple methods, one of which is often quantitative.  No matter what type of research one expects to conduct, one know that without a basic understanding of the language and logic of probability and statistics it is difficult to comprehend even the simplest article in virtually any mainstream political science journal.  As a side benefit, knowledge of statistics will make you a better-informed consumer of the myriad news stories that report the results of surveys and scientific studies from other disciplines.

This survey course covers the major components of U.S. national government. Beginning with the philosophical origins of American constitutionalism, we will proceed to discuss the political and economic context in which the Constitution was written and then examine in detail the Constitution and Bill of Rights. We will then proceed to discussion of the underpinnings of the Constitutional system such as American values, socialization, public opinion and the manner in which they operate.

##  3. <span style="color:#4E9258">Math Camp for Political Scientists</span>

###  Instructor (Graduate)

####  W:2015

<img src="/resources/plot2.pdf" alt="" style="width:800px;height:400px;">


The primary purpose of math camp is to provide students with a set of skills that will be needed to perform well in the quantitative methods courses offered at Rutgers and elsewhere. It will cover the foundational material of matrix algebra, basic calculus and basic probability.

The secondary purpose of math camp is to provide students with computational skills. The basics of  `LaTeX` and `R` will be covered.
