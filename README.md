# Welcome

I'm Héctor Bahamonde, a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science in Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ). This is my website.


## Open Source and Replicability

In this website I will be posting my work. I use the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package, so all I do is fully replicable. You can find the data and the respective ```R´´ coding in my repositories. 

### This website
This website is proudly hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I used the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme, and did some modifications using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Feel free to fork and make your own. See "License" below.
