# Welcome

<p class="lead">
I'm HÃ©ctor Bahamonde, a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science in Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ). This is my website.

## Open Source and Replicability

In this website I will be posting my work. I use the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package, so all I do is fully replicable. You can find the data and the respective `R` and `LaTeX` codings in my repositories.
