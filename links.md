## Replicability 

I believe *everything* should be replicable and open source.

### Research

When available, all my papers, data, R and LaTeX code will be available in a corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hbahamonde?tab=repositories). 

### Website

This website is proudly open sourced under the [MIT license](https://github.com/hbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and freely hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I modified the free [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme using the free [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) languages, as well as some HTML. Feel free to [fork](https://github.com/hbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io
) and make your own.
