## Rutgers Email Etiquette
As an undergraduate student, it is important that you familiarize yourself with **how to write proper emails** when communicating with your TA. Remember that if you have a question, **contact me first**. Professor are always *very busy*, so it is my job to be the first in trying to answer your questions.
