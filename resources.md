## Rutgers Email Etiquette
As an undergraduate student, it is important that you familiarize yourself with **how to write proper emails** when communicating with your TA. Remember that if you have a question, **contact me first**. Professors are always *very busy*, so it is my job to be the first one in trying to answer your questions.

## Grade Appealing Policy
As an undergraduate student, it is your right to ask for a grade appeal. At the same time, I take grading very seriously. Please, read carefully my policy on grade appeals.

## Recommendation Letters
I am more than happy to write a recommendation letter for you. However, please make sure that I know well the quality of your work as an undergraduate student. Please send me an email with (1) your latest CV, (2) a description of the internship/fellowship you are applying for and (3) a reasonable deadline.

## Appointments
