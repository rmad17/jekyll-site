## Rutgers Email Etiquette
As an undergraduate student, it is important you familiarize yourself with [how to write proper emails](http://uhr.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/userfiles/RU_Toolkit-E-mail_Etiquette.pdf) when communicating with your TA. Remember that if you have a question, [contact me](mailto:hector.bahamonde@rutgers.edu) *first*. Professor are always very busy, so it is my job to be the first in trying to answer your questions.

## Grade Appealing Policy
As an undergraduate student, it is your right to ask for a grade appealing. At the same time, I take grading very seriously. Please, read carefully my policy on grade appeals.

## Appointments
If you need to see me, **do not email me** but instead make an appointment online <a href="https://calendly.com/bahamonde/officehours" target="_blank">here</a>. There is *no* need for confirmation. I will receive an alert when you schedule a meeting with me.
